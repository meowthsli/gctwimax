I'm interested in the working with Seowon 32x0A (GCT) Wimax with Comstar WiMax provider only. So I will specialize this driver to fit.
Command line that works for me Login/pass were acquired via Comstar Site service at (http://service.comstar.ru/lk/control_access.jsp):

*sudo gctwimax --login=wimaxXXXXX --pass=00000 --nspid=000029 --nai=MAC@wimax.comstar-uts.ru --eap-type=5*
